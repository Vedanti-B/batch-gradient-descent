# Batch Gradient Descent from Scratch

This project contains a Python implementation of **Batch Gradient Descent** using a custom class, built from scratch without using scikit-learn. It demonstrates how linear regression can be optimized using the batch version of gradient descent.

## ðŸ“‚ File Included

- `batch gradient descent.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Custom GradientDescent class
  - Implementation for fitting data
  - Visualizations of cost vs iterations

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implements Batch Gradient Descent manually
- Tracks and plots cost function
- Shows convergence visually
- Easy to understand and modify
